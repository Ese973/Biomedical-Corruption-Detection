# Biomedical Image Corruption Detection System

A deep learning system for detecting and classifying image corruption in medial imaging datasets

## Overview

This project addresses a challenging in medical imaging: detecting corrupted or degraded images before they lead to misdiagnosis. Using computer vision and deep learning, this system automatically identifies five types of image corruptions with 93.8% accuracy.
